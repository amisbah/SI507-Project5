Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

    I am accessing the Tumblr API and gathering:
    - Blog information for two blogs to compare the following:
	    - Blog details such as title, url, and number of posts
	    - For each blog, I'm also looking for full descriptions and tag information, including other metadata to compare between the blogs
	    - I'll write 3 CSV files:
	    	- a blog csv that will display overall blog information for both blogs
	    	- a CSV per each blog with detailed post information for 20 cached posts
	    - URL for the API: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts
